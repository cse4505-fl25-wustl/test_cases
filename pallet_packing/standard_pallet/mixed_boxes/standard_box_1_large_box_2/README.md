# Justification
* Input contains 18 total pieces: 12 pieces of 43x43 (large) and 6 pieces of 36x43 (standard)
* 43x43 pieces require large boxes (both dimensions > 36"), fitting 6 per box = 2 large boxes
* 36x43 pieces fit in standard boxes (one dimension â‰¤ 36"), fitting 6 per box = 1 standard box
* Total: 1 standard box + 2 large boxes
* A standard pallet can accommodate mixed boxes as long as total capacity allows
* 1 standard pallet can fit this combination (equivalent to ~2.5 standard boxes worth of space)
