# Justification
* Input contains 18 total pieces: 6 pieces of 43x43 (large) and 12 pieces of 36x43 (standard)
* 43x43 pieces require large boxes (both dimensions > 36"), fitting 6 per box = 1 large box
* 36x43 pieces fit in standard boxes (one dimension â‰¤ 36"), fitting 6 per box = 2 standard boxes
* Total: 2 standard boxes + 1 large box
* A standard pallet can accommodate this mixed configuration
* 1 standard pallet can fit this combination (equivalent to ~2.67 standard boxes worth of space)
