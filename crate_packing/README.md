# Crate packing test cases
Test cases in this directory assume that the client accepts crates.
A crate fits one giant box. The box capacity (footprint) is 46" x 36". 
- when packing along the long side, we can fit:
  - 25 paper prints
  - 18 canvases
- when packing along the short side, we can fit:
  - 19 paper prints
  - 14 canvases

These estimates are based on the material depth:
  - paper prints - 1.83334"
  - canvases - 2.5"
