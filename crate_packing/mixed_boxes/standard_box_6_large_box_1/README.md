# Justification
* Input contains 42 oversized pieces (+36 inches) in both of the dimensions.
* Art pieces are framed prints
* Each piece has both dimensions over 36" so we can fit 24 framed mediums in one crate
* All pieces fit because max dimension for all pieces is less than 46"
* We need 2 crates.
