This expected output is correct because it follows the packing rules where:
- Standard Box Limit: If ANY dimension >36" → requires large box
- Large Box Limit: Up to 43.5" in both directions
- Crate Threshold: >46" → requires custom pallet (won't fit in crate)

Line 1 meets the large box threshold (43 x 43), line 2 meets the standard box limit since both are not above 36" (33 x 43), and line 3 meets the custom threshold since both measurements are above 46" (48 x 50).
