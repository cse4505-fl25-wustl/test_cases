- Line item 1 would need a large box since it exceeds 36in, the threshold for a standard box, for both dimensions. 
- Liten item 2 would fit into a standard box since it only exceeds 36in on one dimension.

Since we have 2 large items and 1 standard item, we can fit all three into a large box (glazing is glass, so 6 pieces can fit in a box) instead of packing them in a large and a standard box.
