# Size Justifications:
## Standard Box is 37" x 11":
- If normally in an 11" box we can fit 4 Canvas Gallery. That means each Canvas Gallery occupies 2.75"
- If normally in an 11" box we can fit 6 Paper Print Framed. That means each Paper Print Gallery occupies 1.83"

# Standard Box:
To Fit 2 Canvas Gallery (2.75") and 4 PPF (1.83") It takes a total of 12.83" which is more than 11". So we can not fit them all 
into a single Standard Box. So we can Split them into 2 standard boxes. 1 for the Canvas Gallery, and 1 for the Paper Prints.
