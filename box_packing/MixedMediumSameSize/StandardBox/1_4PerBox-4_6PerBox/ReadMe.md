Justification:
Standard Box is 37" x 11":
If normally in an 11" box we can fit 4 Canvas Gallery. That means each Canvas Gallery occupies 2.75"
If normally in an 11" box we can fit 6 Paper Print Framed. That means each Paper Print Gallery occupies 1.83"

To Fit 1 Canvas Gallery (2.75") and 4 PPF (1.83" x 4 = 7.33") It takes a total of 10.08" which is less than 11". So we can fit them all 
into a single Standard Box.
