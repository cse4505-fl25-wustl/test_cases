# Size Justifications:
## Standard Box is 37" x 11":
- If normally in an 11" box we can fit 4 Canvas Gallery. That means each Canvas Gallery occupies 2.75"
- If normally in an 11" box we can fit 6 Paper Print Framed. That means each Paper Print Gallery occupies 1.83"
## Oversize Box is 44" Ã— 13":
- If normally in an 13" box and each Canvas Gallery occupies 2.75"
- If normally in an 13" box and each Paper Print Gallery occupies 1.83"

# Standard Box:
To Fit 1 Canvas Gallery (2.75") and 6 PPF (1.83" x 6 = 9.17") It takes a total of 13.75" which is more than 11". So we can not fit them all 
into a single Standard Box. So we can Split them into 2 standard boxes. 1 for the Canvas Gallery, and 1 for the Paper Prints.
